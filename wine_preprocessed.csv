Wine Cube153,5.0,4 750ml bottles for the price of two With way less packaging YES PLEASE! I was nervous it was too good to be true and I wouldn't like the wine but it's fantastic!

Gallo,3.0,This wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end,Simply Wonderful,Littlebit,red,2018-01-09
Gallo,2.0,"I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Target's shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.",A Sweet Red.,Condor9,red,2017-12-15

Fancy Pants,5.0,"Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.",This Wine Made My Party!,California Lawyer,white,2018-01-10

VOGA Italia,5.0,"This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didn't want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.",Highly Recommended,Tunia,white,2018-01-09

Wine Cube153,3.0,"I like the wine and I like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time. But when they re-sized the box a few months ago, it made it impossible to open and setup properly. While I applaud Target for reducing the packaging, this just isn't working.",Wine Is Good - The Cube Is Not,Mike,red,2018-01-10

Handsome Devil,5.0,"Is this the greatest wine in the world, of course not. It is an eminently drinkable wine,as a matter of fact it is my preferred, and go to, table wine. Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering. It is not a big bad Cabernet but it is not that in a good way. Goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise. I always have a bottle on my shelf.",An Outstanding Table Wine,Barquet,red,2018-01-09

California Roots,4.0,"I didnt find this to be sweet at all, but everyones taste differs. I usually dont like sweet wines so I gravitate towards Chardonnay and some Sauvignon Blancs and I felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated.

The only complaint I have is that I found the same tea while visiting an Asian store out of town and it was only 2.00 per box while this one was more than double plus a 2.99 shipping fee. I knocked the rating down one star because of the outrageous price this seller charges.,Very good tea.....,I. Greenelsh,red,2015-10-30
Corona Light,4.639736663699758,"Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens, NY.

Corona Light,4.639736663699758,"Yes! this IS just like the Chinese restaurant tea. I used to receive a tea bag or two from my favorite Chinese take out, but nobody does that anymore. I'd save my teabag for the next day to drink with the leftovers, to enhance the leftovers. Now, I can enjoy this tea anytime. This is a refreshing tea that does not make one feel as if we should be adding milk and/or eating some cookies or cakes with it. This tea can stand alone and refresh the inner soul. I drink it with just a pinch of sugar.",Great tea!!,T. Powell,red,2015-10-30

Corona Light,4.639736663699758,"I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesn't contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people don't like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!","Tasty blend of green, jasmine and oolong tea.

Corona Light,4.639736663699758,"Really, that's all I have to say. I have ordered this tea several times. Tastes EXACTLY like the Chinese tea that you can find in any major Chinese restaurant.",ILOVETHISTEA,Katy Hannah,red,2015-10-30
Corona Light,4.639736663699758,"I really like the taste of the tea, especially cold. It's a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and they've added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I don't even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way! You don't have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.","Good taste, but is it real Ginseng",phoongdan,red,2015-10-30

Cupcake Vineyards,4.0,I was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines.

The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday.

Patron,4.639736663699758,"This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping.",Great way to try all three flavors...,Wish Upon A Star,red,2015-08-22

There aren't many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles. When only one showed up... well, what the hell.Still a great mixer, but why can't we get it for a reasonable price!!",GREAT PRODUCT- TERRIBLE PRICE!,Steve,red,2015-12-14

Peychauds,4.639736663699758,"Peychaud's is a great way to expand your bitters collection, especially if all you have is the classic Angostura.It's got some nice anise, cherry and other notes in there, and is perfect for a wide variety of cocktails. You can't always use it as a straight up exchange for Angostura, but a lot of times you can. It'll give your cocktail a whole different stir.But why stop at alcoholic drinks Use bitters in all kinds of beverages, both soft and hard.A few dashes of Peychaud's in your root beer or cola will transform it into something sublime. The usually muted vanilla and caramel aromatics will really burst forth.And the perfect hangover cure is lots of bitters and soda.Grab a bottle and don't let it get dusty on your shelf!",Bitters are the cure for whatever ails you...,David P,red,2016-01-18

Peychauds,4.639736663699758,"If you are looking for bitters for an old fashioned, manhattan, or any other drink that simply says bitters in the recipe, this is probably not what you want. Peychauds bitters taste very different than angostura bitters, as they have a character that tastes more like anise, absinthe, or black licorice. If that is indeed what you are looking for, for a drink such a sazerac, then you are in the right place.

It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system.",Taste of Old New Orleans,Robert W. Weibel,red,2016-01-18
Peychauds,4.639736663699758,"This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar. They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesn't show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping. Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size. I don't think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to Absinthe Cocktails by Kate Simon).

boomchugalug,3.0,"I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primary's I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good.

Brand Castle,4.639736663699758,"I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice.

HomeBrewStuff,4.639736663699758,"I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's.","Never judge a book by it's cover, because this Irish Red is amazing",I.

VIRGILS,5.0,"This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but it's sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color. I quit drinking traditional sodas years ago, because of the nasty ingredients and taste. Virgil's is absolute heaven in a root beer float. Virgil's root beer is micro brewed, smooth and creamy and I am addicted to it, I think. It's worth every penny.Description and ingredients:Virgils is a superb blend of spices and herbs gathered from the world over anise, licorice, vanilla (bourbon), cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, sweet birch, molasses, nutmeg, pimento berry oil, balsam oil and cassia oil.Ingredients: Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, citric acid, herbs and spices!

VIRGILS,4.0,"Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgil's RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

Fever-Tree,4.639736663699758,"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.",Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water,Steven Schafersman,red,2015-11-09
Fever-Tree,4.639736663699758,"After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle.

Fever-Tree,4.639736663699758,"Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it.

Cocktail Artist,5.0,"Hi, this is Cocktail Artist Robert Porter. First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What I've done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes it's that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create.

First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dad's old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean.

Powell Mahoney,1.0,"Don't waste your money. Over-rated, over-priced. You could make your own by looking up an online recipe and wouldn't be able to tell the difference.",Nope.,ByPaul H.,red,2017-07-25
Powell Mahoney,5.0,"Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.","Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita",ByBryan Carey,red,2017-07-25

It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regan's, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regan's, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.",Amazing,Deal Shopper,red,2017-01-14

Bittermens,4.0,"The 'Burlesque' has a distinctive central flavor - I think it's walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

Bittermens,2.0,"Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting.

Bittermens,5.0,"While Bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks -- this one is not technically bitters, but a tart shrub -- especially good for adding to Bloody Marys, and an amazing Bloody Shrimp Martini. I'm sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes -- but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain-jane Bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor.

Great Value,1.0,"Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my area's Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.",Don't waste your calories,ppop,red,2017-09-02
Great Value,1.0,"If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase. From now on, I know to go with a more reputable brand.",Horrible!,SarBear2005,red,2017-09-02

The second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole. It was useless and had to be thrown away. It was a ball of sticky, gooey, unshapable dough. Into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand. We had one pack left that I just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand. My little ones even had seconds.

As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine.

Mr. & Mrs. T,5.0,"I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.","Great Product, excellent taste!",Lacoste2014,red,2017-08-15

I removed the lower rack and have some sodas, other various drinks from time to time.... my only and bigest issue with this is that I can never get the temperature down past 51. If that's okay for you, this is a great cooler. My wife likes her wine cold and in an ideal situation temp would be 41-44 degrees. This is not capable of that no matter how long you leave it on. One more thing, everytime you open the door even if it's for a matter of seconds you will see a temperature rise of about 3 degrees. Foolishness.

Kalamera,4.639736663699758,"We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.",So far so good,Sorayalu,red,2015-12-01

COCO REAL,5.0,"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you won't be disappointed. Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters. You'll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.",Your Secret Ingredient,ascNYC,red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.",Not ready for prime time,Dante,red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged. And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant. I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesn't",An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name,Adam Machanic,red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.",A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura,Scott Cherry,red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brother's and Regan's No. 6. Since the traditional Angostura Bitters (essential ingredient in Manhattan and Pegu Club cocktails) is an institution that has extremely wide distribution, this product is piggybacking off the older product's brand recognition and iconic status. So why does this product cost 9.95 for 4 oz. when Regan's No. 6 costs 6.26 for 5 oz. and Fee Brothers costs 6.99 for 5 oz. The answer is that price probably doesn't matter if you've got the distribution. How many bottles of orange bitters you gonna go through this year, BippyBuy Amazon's 3-pack with one bottle of each brand, and you'll be set -- and confused -- for life.Angostura Orange Bitters happen to be very good.",Nice product but price a head scratcher,Daniel B. Williams,red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"a single drop in the glass before you pour a wheat beer (belgian style) does the job much better than a slice of orange. the flavor hit is pure aromatic orange without the nasty taste of the pith.failed experiments included:*more than one drop: over the top*in a glass of budmillcoor lite: weirdly bitter and flavorless at the same time*in a trappist ale: puts the beer out of balanceLynn Hoffman, author The Short Course in Beer",Wheat Beer's Best Friend,"Lynn Hoffman, author:Radiation Days: A Comedy",red,2017-01-14
Angostura,4.875,"Bitters have been so strong in the craft-cocktail scene these days, and we are always searching for the best quality and flavors to put behind our bar. This version of Angostura Bitters (Orange) contributes a wonderfully tart and sweet hint to any drink. We are incredibly happy with the results that have been shown when using these.

I didn't see that in the description and didn't think about it till thy were received. You can peel off the liner but it's a nuisance. Also, I use a Sizzix Big Kick to flatten. At first they were going complete flat and distorted into ovals. After several frustrating attempts, I realized I was using an extra shim from a previous project. If you use just the base plate and the 2 cutting plates, they will turn out perfectly. Also, they cut deep and will stick' to the cutting plate but will pop out very easily.

Alstertor,4.639736663699758,"This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I've tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood I'm in and what I'm putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesn't have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug. As a home brewer I've often thought it would be nice to have a mug like this when I wanted to sample my beer.",Mildly spicy mustard,Doug Erlandson,red,2015-11-16

Carmex,5.0,"I purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago, in preparation for the impending winter months, and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips. In the vast world we all live in today, we are often overwhelmed by the HUGE number of choices we are faced with every day, even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase. I can't thank Carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest. Their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense, get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy, happy lips throughout the holiday season.",The Original Smooth,MitchLed,red,2017-09-23
Carmex,5.0,"My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. I've had dry and chapped lips for so long and I've tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas' PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an 'instinctual urge' and I don't think I've ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. I've only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me. I really love my little tub of Carmex and it's by far one of the best lip remedies I've picked up - at such an affordable price as well!",Unlike any other lip remedy!,LinaL,red,2017-09-23
Carmex,5.0,"I was introduced to this product back in the 80's and this is yet by far the BEST product that I have used and will ever use. It keeps my lips moist and supple. I go out of my way when my pharmacy that I shop does not have my product. However I have learned now for years is to STOCK up, and that is exactly what I do. Thanks to CARMEX for this unique and exquisite product. I'd love to be entered into a commercial if you'd allow me. (SMILE)! I recommend this to all I encounter. Lastly, you have gotten a bit expensive and really there was no need. People who have used your product know QUALITY, but I think your prices are getting a bit profuse, Nonetheless I do stand by you 120",CARMEX LIPBALM,Hotginger,red,2017-09-23

Carmex,5.0,"I started using carmex when I moved back home to Chicago in 1979. A co-worker at the Hospital turned me onto Carmex. She told me it was a staple for Winters in Chicago. I have used it ever since and I live in the Southeast now. It's not just good for sore chapped winter lips it's perfect for surfing, a lipstick base or gloss, or just dry lips. Believe me, just ask my Hubby, I have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so it's always handy. I've traveled the World with my Original Carmex in the jar. Carmex has been with me to Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and all over the USA. I turn everyone on to Carmex that I spark conversation with while traveling !",Since 1979,Kare,red,2017-09-23
Carmex,5.0,"My mom would always keep this jar of Carmex stocked in our bathrooms and nothing else was used in our house. Well, I am all grown up now and I had run out of my beloved Carmex in a jar. Hubby came home with some other brand that was immediately thrown in the trash. He obviously did not understand my love for the familiar soothing scent, the way it immediately took care of my dry lips and the yellow cover with the white pot. I found it in the store. Picked up five.Checked out, in the car, tore into one of those wrappers, opened one of those pots and that familiar friend was back!!

I have a pot of carmex in every room of my house, my car, my purses -- EVERYWHERE!!! I have tried all of the other lip products out there and the ONLY one I find absolutely reliable everytime is Carmex. My lips have stayed so soft for so many years and I never have chapped lips.

There are not many products out there, that I have found, that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do, but this one does. At the first hint of a cold sore, I grab the Carmex as quickly as I can. and apply it. It stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out. If I can't find my little jar, I panic and hurry to the store to buy another one. (No one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore!) I've always thought it amazing that a product that works so well, would be so affordable!",Always comes through for me!,Gigi20,red,2017-09-23

The orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days, I also used the original jar but right now I don't remember where I put it so I haven't used it.

Carmex,5.0,"So I recently moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Huge elevation difference. A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didn't even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80 better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it.",Amazing,MelRose1125,red,2017-09-23

Carmex,5.0,"I have been using Carmex since the 80s when my mother introduced me to it. I in turn introduced it to my husband, he cannot do without it. Due to his addiction we probably keep 10 -15 jars stashed around the house and in the cars. One on each side of the bed, one in the bathroom, one in each of our cars. There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case. My only disappointment was the day I went to buy an new jar and the package felt different... My beloved jar was now plastic. My little wonderfully feeling porcelain (I believe) jar was gone, I have to admit, that month I searched for my beloved jar in every store I went, in the hopes that they had not sold out of them, only to be replaced by the new plastic jar.

From harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun, along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between, Carmex has relieved it all. From the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened, to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you, and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application...it's happiness to my senses! I use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day, and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped/dry lips.

So, I was out at my local drug store and seen the Carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort - boy, was I so glad that I did! Carmex has been a life saver for me. I know that sounds shallow, but it's the truth. I felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the Carmex soothed them. Needless to say, I have jars and tubes of Carmex every where in my house, car, purses, etc. You can never have enough. I use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected.

It's actually the only lipcare that I use--also perfect as a base before I put on lipstick. It just absolutely works. That's it. A lot of other brands work for an hour or few, but with Carmex your lips stay moisturized well, and helps to prevent cold sores, although I don't get them, it's nice to know that it also will care for them.

Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty.

After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case.

The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like you'd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that I'm a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring.

Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.",Highly Recommended,Tunia,white,2018-01-30

Cocktail Artist,5.0,"Hi, this is Cocktail Artist Robert Porter. First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What I've done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes it's that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create. Make the glass your canvas, mix it like you mean it. Robert.",It's that easy!!!,AzCocktailArtist,red,2017-08-15

This mix... this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy ... is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream I need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends. It's that freaking good folks... buy it... buy cases of it... snort it, drink it, shoot it, whatever you do ... just try it!

Enter the Cocktail Artist Essential Bar Ingredients Premium Manhattan Mix. Making my pre-shindig trip to Walmart, I circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out.

I didn't care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" I'd like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. I'd say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who haven't heard of the bartenura comparison, it's a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as O'Leary. If you're curious about this, if say take a chance.

First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dad's old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean.

boomchugalug,3.0,"I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primary's I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good.

boomchugalug,5.0,"I haven't had a chance to brew this beer, but everything about the process has been great so far. They are in state, so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb. The kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain - but it's important. Funny detail, and gives me a sense of their personality. Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit I've purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast.

Despite my rookie mistake by moving it to secondary fermentation after active fermentation was over it was a forgiving beer.

Mr. & Mrs. T,5.0,"I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.","Great Product, excellent taste!",Lacoste2014,red,2017-08-15

Les Trois Petits Cochons,3.0,A good Chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan. This Chorizo does not. Don Quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find.

MODERN COCKTAIL,3.0,"I like the Modern Cocktail packs, but was a little misled by the description for this one on Amazon.Possibly not the manufacturer's fault - their package description is spot on.On Amazon it says something like 'add gin or vodka for Martinis and other similar drinks.'But this one is all formulated for Tequila - all the drinks are Margaritas or other tequila drinks.Instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks, this one comes with salt.I am not saying it's bad - for 0 calories, obviously they couldn't use sugar. but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something.As long as you know what to expect - a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt - then they are fine. of course, you can put whatever liquor you want in there, but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me.Here is exactly what the drinks are: Mango Skinny Margarita, Blood Orange Tequila Sunrise, Classic Skinny Margarita, Strawberry Tequila Lemonade, Acai Blueberry Skinny Margarita.","Not sweet, not martinis--salty Tequila/Margaritas",ByJulie Bulie,red,2017-08-05

I used cheaper tequila, Jose Cuervo, which was just fine.",Suprisingly good!,ByMichelle,red,2017-08-05
MODERN COCKTAIL,5.0,"This is a good product to acquire via commerce if you are desperate for a liquid to possess. It can be placed in a container. Swallowing it is possible. It can go in your mouth region. Alcohol is intended to go into it, and I personally recommend that you dilute these liquids with booze flavors. The boozeahol can help to momentarily distract you from the uncomfortable truth that the acai blueberry fluid tastes like you hijacked the Smurfs' Winnebago and put its tire in your mouth. All in all, these liquids do not contain dangerous solids which may choke you, so they successfully could be considered fluid. Drink them.

COCO REAL,5.0,"I love this stuff. I like Coco LoPez but it is in a can which makes it difficult to use just a couple of tablespoons. I add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop. Right now I am using it with an orange chicken stir fry. My problem is that I have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the Walmart stores where I bought it originally. While this is a great product I really don't want to buy a case of it. However, if that is the only way I can get it I may have no other choice. Please start stocking this in the stores.",Great in smoothies,GrammyAngie,red,2017-09-06
COCO REAL,5.0,"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy. It's the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled.",This makes a great syrup for pancakes and waffles!,joydoctor,red,2017-09-06

Mr. & Mrs. T,5.0,"I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores). Usually, I am not a fan of any bar drink mixes, particularly now sugary ones, but this one is a fabulous concoction! Not too sweet, the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour, with a touch of bitter almonds. Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer). I have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer :) Had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors. We are hooked! Wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable SH charge. It arrived in good condition (product is shelf stable).

A waste of precious quality vodka. I quickly figured out that for me, only salt brines will do. No vinegar.I was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only. I read reviews and ingredient lists until finding Dirty Sue. This product ain't cheap (it's salt water after all) but I was not disappointed. Like I said before, NO VINEGAR. I'm very pleased.

Dirty Sue,5.0,"This product is great! I am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in Hollywood, CA and I was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives. It's a huge waste of time, and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately. Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Let's face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it",Why couldn't I have thought of this!,ByJ. Rinella,red,2017-07-12

Powell Mahoney,5.0,"Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.","Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita",ByBryan Carey,red,2017-07-25

Cupcake Vineyards,4.0,I was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines.

Bittermens,2.0,"Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material.

Bittermens,4.0,"The 'Burlesque' has a distinctive central flavor - I think it's walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regan's, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.",Amazing,ByMary Anderson,red,2017-08-05

VIRGILS,4.0,"Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgil's RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz. (355mL).Amount Per Serving:Calories 160.Total Fat 0g.Sodium 0g.Total Carbohydrate 42g (Sugars 42g).Protein 0g.Ingredients:Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, herbs, spices and citric acid.Also listed ingredients: Anise, Licorice, Vanilla (Bourbon), Cinnamon, Clove, Wintergreen, Sweet Birch, Molasses, Nutmeg, Pimento Berry Oil, Balsam Oil and Oil of Cassia.CONTAINS NO PRESERVATIVES OR CAFFEINE.

VIRGILS,5.0,"This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but it's sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color. I quit drinking traditional sodas years ago, because of the nasty ingredients and taste. Virgil's is absolute heaven in a root beer float. Virgil's root beer is micro brewed, smooth and creamy and I am addicted to it, I think. It's worth every penny.Description and ingredients:Virgils is a superb blend of spices and herbs gathered from the world over anise, licorice, vanilla (bourbon), cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, sweet birch, molasses, nutmeg, pimento berry oil, balsam oil and cassia oil.Ingredients: Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, citric acid, herbs and spices!

Master of Mixes,5.0,"I am a whiskey sour lover, but imbibing only when out to dinner. Hubby suggested trying home. I was so happy to find this product my Walmart Supercenter! First, it's taste is great. Not much difference in taste from Mr. and Mrs. T's, which is slightly higher in price. Prior to purchasing Walmart, wasn't aware they carried mixers - foolish on my part - duh, they have everything! I was paying like 4.50 to 5.00 per bottle other stores. At Walmart, believe it or not, it is...........2.88!!!!!!! So I stocked up bought 3 bottles. They also have it in a lite version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesn't taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart! I especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out, especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold the Supercenters, and we have 4 within a 20 mile radius......but only one has it!",Great stuff!,Sauderhouse,red,2017-09-06

Vintage Wine Estates,2.0,"I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not!

After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case.

I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring. Very good wine, Mr. O'Leary.",Pleasantly Surprised!,BlackScorpio,red,2018-02-06
